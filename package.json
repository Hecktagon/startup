  "description": "I love learning languages. The ability to communicate with a new culture in a completely unique way, as well as the thrill of seeing improvement in your own abilities have led me to learn 4 languages in addition to my native language. In this process, I have tried just about every software on the market for learning a language. Duolingo, Pimsleur, HelloTalk, Anki, Quizlet, and many others each have their uses, but personally, I have yet to encounter a software that encompasses all of the essential components of learning a language in one neat, user-friendly application. Based on my own language learning experience, such an app would allow a user to learn up to 1000 vocabulary words, the basics of the grammar, and gain a comfortability in understanding and speaking to native speakers in as little as two months, while only taking up 15-30 minutes a day of the userâ€™s time.  \r <br><br>\r ## Sketch:  \r The app will open on a login screen, after which the user will be sent to a home screen with links to other parts of the app:\r <br>\r <img width=\"362\" alt=\"Home_Screen\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac01b3ed-53a5-4be2-8d36-e5703560aed3\">",
