# Startup Specifications 

## Elevator Pitch:
I love learning languages. The ability to communicate with a new culture in a completely unique way, as well as the thrill of seeing improvement in your own abilities have led me to learn 4 languages in addition to my native language. In this process, I have tried just about every software on the market for learning a language. Duolingo, Pimsleur, HelloTalk, Anki, Quizlet, and many others each have their uses, but personally, I have yet to encounter a software that encompasses all of the essential components of learning a language in one neat, user-friendly application. Based on my own language learning experience, such an app would allow a user to learn up to 1000 vocabulary words, the basics of the grammar, and gain a comfortability in understanding and speaking to native speakers in as little as two months, while only taking up 15-30 minutes a day of the userâ€™s time.

## Sketch:  
The app will open on a login screen, after which the user will be sent to a home screen with links to other parts of the app:

The main feature of the app will be the Vocab section, in which users can create, upload, and import folders and flashcard sets:

Within the Vocabuly section, users can access flashcard sets organised into folders. individual sets will have notifications on them reminding the reader when it is time to review a set for maximum retention:

Also included in the app will be a live chat, which can match users up with other users who speak the language they are trying to learn:

<br>
### Potential other additions to the application may include:  
A simplified, duolingo-like grammar course section.  
A voice-chat option for practicing listening and speaking.  
AI translation suggestions for the flashcard creation process.  
Grammar hints attached to phrases within vocab flashcards.

## Technologies:  
### HTML:  
Correctly formatted HTML will be laced throughout the program to structure the login page, home page, vocabulary pages, chat pages, and possibly eventually some grammar pages. All pages will contain hyperlinks to allow easy navigation for the user.  

### CSS:  
Css will be applied on top of the HTML to ensure proper fitting for different sized screens, good spacing, and a pleasant color scheme. 

### Javascript:  
Javascript will be an essential tool for allowing the user to login to their own personally customised account, create, share, and import language learning resources like flashcard sets, and to code the functionality of the flashcards, allowing the user to flip the card and determine whether or not they have mastered the terms thereon. It will also be used to keep track of which sets the user has studied and when, and remind the user to study each set in accordance with spaced review. 

### React:  
React will be used to supply the user with a very interactive, customiseable, and responsive UI system.

### Web Services:  
other web services such as potentially IP stack, and services for translation will be integrated into the application to track and identify users, and to allow for automated translation suggestions.

### Authentication:  
Users will log in and their information will be stored to allow each user to create/assemble their own library of language resources to fit their needs.

### WebSocket Data:  
Users will be able to live chat with oither users in order to exchange languages and practice using their newfound vocabulary and grammar with natives and other learners.


# **Step 1 HTML:**

The initial implementation of the HTML has a few differences from the original plan. Upon seeing how complex it will be to design this website, I decided to focus on the flashcards portion of the website, and will add other features, like a chat and vocab lessons if time permits. p.s. sorry my files are disgustingly disorganised, it was the only way I could get my images to display on the website.  

My site now contains a login page, a home page with paths to a settings and main vocab page, a vocab sets page, a flashcard set maker page, and a flashcard page.   

### Login:  
The login page is pretty stereotypical, and similar to the Simon login page, accepting an email, a username, and a password to be used later.  

### Home:  
The home page is pretty straightfoward, with some nav links, and some buttons that take you to vocab and settings.  

### Settings:  
The settings page allows the user to select a color scheme and set some preferences for their flashcards using various input elements ***(Database)***. the functionality will be implemented later.  

### Vocab:  
This page contains folders of flashcard sets broken up usually by language, to be implemented is an add folder button that will allow the user to create and store their own language data/sets ***(Database)***. The add folder button will eventually also allow the user to search folders made by other users and import them ***(Websocket/Database)***. 

### Flashcard sets:  
Upon clicking on a vocab folder, you are taken to a library of sets of flashcards for the user to study, and given an option to make more sets ***(Database)***. When another user is studying a set made by you, you will receive a notification ***(Websocket)***. 

### Set maker:  
When the user clicks "make a set" they are directed to the set maker page, where they can insert either a CSV format text to be broken up into flashcards, or a manual interface with calls to a translation service ***(3rd party service call)*** to help the user make new sets.   

### Flashcards:  
When the user clicks on one of ther flashcard sets, they are presented with a simplistic flashcard display, which will cycle through flashcards in the set, play audio from a call to an AI voice service ***(3rd party service call)***, and keep track fo which flashcards the user knows, and which they dont know ***(Database)***.  


# **Step 2 CSS:**  

### Changes:   
I made a couple funcitonality changes to the website, the main one being cutting out the flashcard_sets.html page, and allowing users to just have one large database of flashcards per floder, instead of multiple sets. I inted to implemetn some sort of way for users to rank the importance of their flaschards to allow them to control what order they learn terms in.   

### Header, footer, and main content body:  
Each page contains a header and footer that come intially on a blue background. The header for each page contains the title of the page, as well as a username and profile picture. The footer for each page contains useful links to other places in the website, including a back button. It also contains the github link in the bottom right corner. Each page has a unique main content body to sevr the puroses of that page. this main content body is displayed between the header and footer, intitally on a white background.   

### Navigation elements:  
The Footer contains a nav box with links to the home and login pages, as well as a back button to allow the user to back out of certain pages. The Menu and Vocab pages also contain buttons that link to other pages.  

### Responsive to window resizing:  
Holy cow this was painful to implement, but I finally got all my pages to be reasonably responsive to resizing, I even checked the website on my phone and it seems to resize pretty well.   

### Application elements:  
There are a lot of application elements. There is a button on the vocab page "make new folder" that takes the user to a flashcard maker page, in which they can make and add flashcards, either one at a time, in in bulk using CSV format, and then edit or delete the flashcards they are making. There is also a setting page accesible from the main menu which has elements that will allow users to set a custom color scheme, as well as customise their flashcard experience. the flashcard page itself allows users to study flaschards from their sets, and will keep track of which terms the users did and ddint know.   

### Application text content:  
There is a lot of text content, including labels on buttons and textboxes to help the user navigate the site, and many places for the user to input text.  

### Application images:  
The most prominent images on the website are the user profile picture, and the coverrs for the vocab buttons. Both of these will eventually be customizeable by the user.
