# Startup Specifications 

## Elevator Pitch:
I love learning languages. The ability to communicate with a new culture in a completely unique way, as well as the thrill of seeing improvement in your own abilities have led me to learn 4 languages in addition to my native language. In this process, I have tried just about every software on the market for learning a language. Duolingo, Pimsleur, HelloTalk, Anki, Quizlet, and many others each have their uses, but personally, I have yet to encounter a software that encompasses all of the essential components of learning a language in one neat, user-friendly application. Based on my own language learning experience, such an app would allow a user to learn up to 1000 vocabulary words, the basics of the grammar, and gain a comfortability in understanding and speaking to native speakers in as little as two months, while only taking up 15-30 minutes a day of the userâ€™s time.

## Sketch:  
The app will open on a login screen, after which the user will be sent to a home screen with links to other parts of the app:

The main feature of the app will be the Vocab section, in which users can create, upload, and import folders and flashcard sets:

Within the Vocabuly section, users can access flashcard sets organised into folders. individual sets will have notifications on them reminding the reader when it is time to review a set for maximum retention:

Also included in the app will be a live chat, which can match users up with other users who speak the language they are trying to learn:

<br>
### Potential other additions to the application may include:  
A simplified, duolingo-like grammar course section.  
A voice-chat option for practicing listening and speaking.  
AI translation suggestions for the flashcard creation process.  
Grammar hints attached to phrases within vocab flashcards.

## Technologies:  
### HTML:  
Correctly formatted HTML will be laced throughout the program to structure the login page, home page, vocabulary pages, chat pages, and possibly eventually some grammar pages. All pages will contain hyperlinks to allow easy navigation for the user.  

### CSS:  
Css will be applied on top of the HTML to ensure proper fitting for different sized screens, good spacing, and a pleasant color scheme. 

### Javascript:  
Javascript will be an essential tool for allowing the user to login to their own personally customised account, create, share, and import language learning resources like flashcard sets, and to code the functionality of the flashcards, allowing the user to flip the card and determine whether or not they have mastered the terms thereon. It will also be used to keep track of which sets the user has studied and when, and remind the user to study each set in accordance with spaced review. 

### React:  
React will be used to supply the user with a very interactive, customiseable, and responsive UI system.

### Web Services:  
other web services such as potentially IP stack, and services for translation will be integrated into the application to track and identify users, and to allow for automated translation suggestions.

### Authentication:  
Users will log in and their information will be stored to allow each user to create/assemble their own library of language resources to fit their needs.

### WebSocket Data:  
Users will be able to live chat with oither users in order to exchange languages and practice using their newfound vocabulary and grammar with natives and other learners.


# **Step 1 HTML:**

The initial implementation of the HTML has a few differences from the original plan. Upon seeing how complex it will be to design this website, I decided to focus on the flashcards portion of the website, and will add other features, like a chat and vocab lessons if time permits.  

My site now contains a login page, a home page with paths to a settings and main vocab page, a vocab sets page, a flashcard set maker page, and a flashcard page.   

### Login:  
The login page is pretty stereotypical, and similar to the Simon login page, accepting an email, a username, and a password to be used later.  

### Home:  
The home page is pretty straightfoward, with some nav links, and some buttons that take you to vocab and settings.  

### Settings:  
The settings page allows the user to select a color scheme and set some preferences for their flashcards using various input elements. the functionality will be implemented later.  

### Vocab:  
This page contains folders of flashcard sets broken up usually by language, to be implemented is an add folder button that will allow the user to create and store their own language data/sets.  

### Flashcard sets:  
Upon clicking on a vocab folder, you are taken to a library of sets of flashcards for the user to study, and given an option to make more sets.  

### Set maker:  
When the user clicks "make a set" they are directed to the set maker page, where they can insert either a CSV format text to be broken up into flashcards, or a manual interface with calls to a translation service to help the user make new sets.   

### Flashcards:  
When the user clicks on one of ther flashcard sets, they are presented with a simplistic flashcard display, which will cycle through flashcards in the set, play audio from a call to an AI voice service, and keep track fo which flashcards the user knows, and which they dont know.
